# CUDA-ffmpeg-GUI

h265 / x264 accelerated ffmpeg encoder GUI with frame interpolation options.

Uses precompiled CUDA-enabled ffmpeg from here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

You'll need ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe from gyan.dev's packages in the same folder where this python script is executed (or in environment variable).
